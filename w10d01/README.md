# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [x] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [x] MVC Review
- [x] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [x] Nested Resources

### Rails Week Convo
* file/folder management seems to be a nightmare
* didn't like working with css
* i like the generators
* definitely a shift
* routing was confusing
* a LOT of abstraction (confusing) 
* ambiguous syntax
* too much automagic!
* easy to get lost in the sauce
* ERB!!! ðŸ‘¿
* possibly hard to hook up to React
* possibly confused by relationships
* helper methods are mysterious things

### Model View Controller
* Model - our data, talks to the database
* View - template, ERB, rendering HTML pages, helper functions
* Controller - talks to HTTP clients, talks to the model and the view



```rb
"hello world"

user = {
  :first_name => 'john'
}

user["first_name"]
user[:first_name] # lightweight strings

:first_name
```
